# Oxygen OS 16 for Oneplus ACE 3v
Porting Oxygen OS from OnePlus Nord 4 to OnePlus Ace 3v
Device codename : audi
Android Version : 16

# Bugs (all are not critical) :
- opening camera by double-clicking power button disappears after reboot
- play integrity check fail (google **pay (not play)** not working without root interference)
- brightness curve is a little off—the brightness isn't adjusted evenly, but I don't see this as a problem; when the brightness is lowered all the way, the screen **doesn't go black**
